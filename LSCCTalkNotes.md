# ggplot2

## What is ggplot?

- A single package for creating a diverse range of plots in R
- A natural way to graphically express structured data
- Implementation of the [grammar of graphics](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/layered-grammar.pdf)

## Comparison with other plotting frameworks

- Individual plotting functions `plot`, `barplot`, `hist` typically represent data in a single way.  Some limited modification of the plot (eg colours) is usually possible but differs between plot types and is often quite limited
